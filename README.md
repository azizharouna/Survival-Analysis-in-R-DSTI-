# Survival-Analysis of the time to get an Internship for DSTI students

The idea of this project was given as an assessment of the cours Survival analysis in R taught by the Prof. Fabio Di Narzo at Data Science Tech Institute.
The Objective is to predict the time to get an  internship of a student in DSTI and to evaluate what are the variables 
that affect it, given the features that we are provided with in this dataset. The features that we are interested in for this analysis are the Duration,cohort, status(did the 
student find an internship?), age, education background and having or not having children.
